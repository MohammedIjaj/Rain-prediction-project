# Rain Prediction Project üåßÔ∏è

Welcome to the Rain Prediction Project! This project aims to predict rainfall based on various weather-related features. Whether you're a weather enthusiast or just curious about data science, you've come to the right place.

## About the Project

- **Objective:** The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data.

- **Dataset:** We've used a comprehensive dataset containing features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, to train and evaluate our models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn libraries

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rain-prediction-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd rain-prediction-project
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Explore the project and run the notebooks:
   - `Data_Preparation.ipynb`: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Explore the dataset and visualize patterns.
   - `Model_Training.ipynb`: Train and evaluate machine learning models.
   - `Model_Deployment.ipynb`: Deploy the best model for predictions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to improve the models, add visualizations, or enhance the documentation, your input is valuable. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
